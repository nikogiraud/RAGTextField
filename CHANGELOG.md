## 0.12.0

## 0.11.0

### Added
- Added property `transformedPlaceholderColor` that sets the placeholder color when the text field is being edited and the placeholder is in its floating position.

### Fixed

## 0.10.0

After updating to this version, you may have to adjust the `placeholderMode` values of your text fields because the default placeholder mode has changed.

### Added
- Added the `textField` property to the `UnderlineView`. If not `nil`, the underline updates its appearance in accordance with the editing state of the text field.

### Fixed
- View performs a layout pass when the text padding mode is set
- View no longer animates the placeholder when the text propert is set

## 0.8.0
